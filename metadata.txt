description=Creates a field layout for a typical row-column breeder's trial
version=0.1
author=Jose A. Jimenez Berni
email=jose.jimenez.berni@csic.es

about=This plug-in allows to create a grid of polygons which define the plots in the breeding trial. Create an empty layer to start with a layer that contains the minum columns: Row-Range-PlotID. These numbers will be labeled automatically with auto-increments. Create a new feature with the shape of the plot, save it. Then, select the feature and define the spacing and angle to 'clone' the feature through the experiment.
